An online store dealing exclusively in African Coffee. I'm particularly proud of this project as it was my very first attempt at building anything once I'd learned enough HTML, CSS and JavaScript to do so. The JS was particualry challenging, as I'd not yet learned any frameworks that would have simplified quite a number of tasks; but I understood the importance of getting to grips with the fundamentals first.
